# Fixtures List Generator

### What does it do?
It generates a list of fixtures for teams of your choice and prints them to the console.

### How do I use it?
1. Download the code
2. Create a text file for your teams, with each team on a new line
3. Run the program 
`python main.py <path_to_your_text_file>`

#### Credits
Gaucho's video on YouTube helped me a lot to get started
His code is in C and doesn't appear to work for all numbers of even teams, so I created this.
